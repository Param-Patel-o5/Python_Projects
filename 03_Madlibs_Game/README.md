# 📖 Random Story Generator – Python CLI Fun Project

A fun little Python program that generates a random silly story based on the user's input. The user provides a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb — and the script picks a random story template and fills in the blanks.

## 🎯 How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter:
  - A noun
  - A verb
  - An adjective
  - An adverb
- It randomly selects one of several story templates.
- The placeholders are replaced with the user's words to generate a unique story.
