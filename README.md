# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

A growing collection of small, hands-on Python projects built while learning and revising core programming concepts. Each project is written from scratch, focusing on logic, structure, and real understanding — not just tutorial copying.

## 📌 What's Inside

A collection of small, hands-on Python projects created as part of my learning process.

Each project is stored in its own folder:

- `main.py` (or `project_name.py`)
- A short `README.md` explaining the project

---

and will be updated regularly as I progress.


## 🚀 Goal

The goal is **not perfection**, but **consistency** and **real coding muscle**.  
Tutorials are used only for understanding — every project is built manually and revised regularly.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Reinforce Python fundamentals through hands-on practice
- Build coding habit by doing instead of just watching
- Improve logic, problem-solving, and debugging skills
- Prepare foundation for real-world projects
