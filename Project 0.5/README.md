This is a simple Python-based number guessing game. The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives a hint — either "higher" or "lower" — based on how close the guess is to the target number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and then it displays the total number of attempts taken. It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
