# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python CLI Project

A simple Python command-line game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it in as few tries as possible.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player inputs guesses until the correct number is found.
- After each guess, the program tells the player whether the correct number is higher or lower.
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly, and it displays the total number of attempts.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `while` loops
- `if`/`elif` conditions
- `randint` from Python's `random` module
- Input handling
- Basic game logic and feedback
